## Overview

# CoraMQ v0.1.0

I recently built a **Concurrent In-Memory Queue Service** in **Go** to support multiple clients, priority-based message processing, and a visibility timeout for unacknowledged items. This service is ideal for scenarios involving a producer-consumer pattern where messages are dequeued, processed, and acknowledged by consumers.

The goal was to design a scalable, thread-safe queue system for high-performance environments where multiple clients interact with the same queue.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Queue Support:** Each queue is identified by a unique name.
- **Priority Queue:** Higher priority items are dequeued first.
- **Visibility Timeout:** Once dequeued, messages are invisible for a set period (default: 10 seconds) before being available for dequeuing again.
- **In-Flight Tracking:** Keeps track of messages currently being processed.
- **Acknowledgment:** Messages are removed from the queue upon acknowledgment, preventing reprocessing.
- **Thread-Safety:** The queue service is designed to handle concurrent requests safely.

## Architecture Overview

The service is built with three core components:

- **QueueItem:** Represents a single item in the queue, including its ID, payload, priority, visibility timeout, and acknowledgment status.
- **Queue:** Manages a list of `QueueItems` and uses a priority heap to ensure higher-priority items are dequeued first.
- **QueueServer:** Oversees multiple queues, handles creation, enqueuing, dequeuing, and acknowledgment of items. It uses Go channels and mutex locks to ensure thread-safe, concurrent access.

## API Overview

The queue service exposes a simple API with endpoints for interacting with queues and items. Here are a few key endpoints:

### 1. **Create Queue**

- **Endpoint:** `/queues`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "queueName": "High-priority"
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Queue created successfully",
  "queueName": "High-priority"
}
```

- **Status Code:** `201 Created` (if the queue is successfully created)

- **Status Code:** `400 Bad Request` (if the queue already exists)

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Queue with the given name already exists",
  "queueName": "High-priority"
}
```

### 2. **Enqueue Item**

- **Endpoint:** `/queues/{queueName}/enqueue`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "item": {
    "id": "3",
    "payload": "{'name': 'Lorem Ipsum', 'email': 'loremipsum@gmail.com'}",
    "priority": 5
  }
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Item enqueued successfully",
  "item": {
    "id": "3",
    "payload": "{'name': 'Lorem Ipsum', 'email': 'loremipsum@gmail.com'}",
    "priority": 5
  }
}
```

### 3. **Dequeue Item**

- **Endpoint:** `/queues/{queueName}/dequeue`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "queueName": "queueName"
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Item dequeued successfully",
  "item": {
    "id": "3",
    "payload": "{'name': 'Lorem Ipsum', 'email': 'loremipsum@gmail.com'}",
    "priority": 5,
    "visibilityTimeout": "2024-10-07T12:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Acknowledge Item**

- **Endpoint:** `/queues/{queueName}/acknowledge`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "itemId": "3"
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Item acknowledged successfully",
  "itemId": "3"
}
```

- **Status Code:** `200 OK` (if the item is acknowledged successfully)

- **Status Code:** `404 Not Found` (if the item was not found in the in-flight queue)

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Item not found in the in-flight queue",
  "itemId": "3"
}
```

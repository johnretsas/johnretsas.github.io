# Getting Started with a Node.js TypeScript Boilerplate using esbuild

Setting up a modern Node.js project with **TypeScript**, **Axios**, and **ESLint** provides a solid foundation for building scalable applications. But what if you want a fast and efficient bundling tool to speed up your development process? Enter **esbuild**—a fast bundler and minifier that will help you compile TypeScript code and bundle your application with ease.

In this blog post, we will walk through setting up a **Node.js project with TypeScript**, using **esbuild** for bundling, and integrating **Axios** for HTTP requests and **ESLint** for maintaining code quality.

## Why Use TypeScript for Node.js?

TypeScript provides type safety and improved tooling over plain JavaScript, allowing you to catch errors early and build maintainable applications. Benefits of using TypeScript include:

- **Type Safety**: Helps to catch type errors before runtime, reducing bugs.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Tools like autocompletion and inline documentation make coding easier.
- **Better Refactoring**: The strict typing allows for safer, easier code refactoring.

## Why Use esbuild?

While TypeScript provides the structure and safety for your code, bundlers like **esbuild** help with bundling your TypeScript files into a single, optimized output for deployment. Esbuild offers:

- **Lightning-fast performance**: esbuild is known for its speed, offering quick builds and fast rebuilds during development.
- **Built-in minification**: Minifying your code for production is easy with esbuild.
- **Simple configuration**: It’s simple to set up and integrates well with TypeScript projects.

## Features of the Node.js TypeScript Boilerplate with esbuild

This boilerplate includes everything you need to get started:

- **TypeScript**: The project is configured to use modern TypeScript with `ESNext` module support, enabling the latest JavaScript features.
- **Axios**: Axios is pre-configured for making HTTP requests.
- **ESLint**: To ensure your code follows consistent coding standards.
- **esbuild**: Used for bundling your TypeScript code into a single output file.
- **Type Declarations**: Automatic generation of `.d.ts` files for type support and IDE autocompletion.

## How to Set Up the Node.js TypeScript Boilerplate

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnretsas/node-ts-boilerplate.git
cd node-ts-boilerplate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages, including TypeScript, Axios, ESLint, `esbuild`, and `tsx`.

### Step 3: Run the Project

#### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will use `tsx` to automatically reload the application when changes are detected in the source files.

#### Build the Application

To compile your TypeScript code into a bundled JavaScript file using esbuild, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `build.js` script uses esbuild to bundle your TypeScript files and outputs the result to `dist/bundle.js`.

Here's a quick look at the `build.js` script:

```js
import { build } from 'esbuild';

const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'; // Check if we're in production

build({
  entryPoints: ['./src/index.ts'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: './dist/bundle.js',
  resolveExtensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.json'],
  sourcemap: !isProd, // Enable source maps in development
  minify: isProd, // Minify in production
  target: 'esnext', // Target modern JavaScript
}).catch(() => process.exit(1)); // Exit process if build fails
```

#### Start the Application

Once the project is built, you can start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the compiled `bundle.js` from the `dist/` folder.

#### Clean Build Files

To remove the compiled build files, run:

```bash
npm run clean
```

### Step 4: Lint Your Code

To maintain code quality, run ESLint to check for errors or issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will run ESLint across your project and provide feedback on any issues.

### Step 5: Type Checking

You can perform type checking to ensure that your TypeScript code is correctly typed without generating output files using:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

This will validate the types in your TypeScript files based on the settings in your `tsconfig.json`.

## Development vs. Production

In your build process, it’s important to distinguish between development and production environments. In **development**, you want fast rebuilds with source maps enabled for easier debugging. In **production**, however, you should minify your code to reduce file size and improve load times.

The `build.js` script checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to adjust the configuration for each environment:

- **Development**: Enables source maps and skips minification for faster rebuilds.
- **Production**: Minifies the code to reduce file size and excludes source maps.

## Conclusion

This boilerplate gives you a fast and efficient way to develop and bundle your Node.js applications with TypeScript, Axios, ESLint, and **esbuild**. By using **esbuild** for bundling, you're getting a lightning-fast build process, and the combination of **TypeScript** and **Axios** ensures a robust and maintainable codebase.

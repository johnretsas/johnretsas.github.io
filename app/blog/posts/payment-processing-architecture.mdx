summary: A high-level overview of building a scalable, PSP-agnostic payment processing system in Laravel using SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and Singleton pattern for service management.

## **Overview**

This application is designed to manage **payment processing for merchants** using various Payment Service Providers (PSPs), such as **Stripe** and **PinPayments**. The system follows a **modular, scalable, and testable architecture** that adheres to **SOLID principles**, making it easy to add new PSPs in the future.

## **Key Architectural Principles**

### **1. PSP-Agnostic Payment Processing (Dependency Inversion - "D" in SOLID)**

- The application employs a **PaymentServiceInterface** to standardize the interactions between the system and multiple PSPs.
- The payment processing logic for each PSP (e.g., **StripePaymentService** and **PinPaymentService**) is encapsulated in separate classes, which **decouple** the payment logic from the rest of the system.
- This approach allows us to easily add more PSPs by implementing the interface and updating the service factory.

### **2. Using Singletons for PSP Services (Singleton Pattern)**

- Instead of creating new instances of PSP services (such as `new StripePaymentService()`), the system utilizes **singletons** to manage PSP services. This ensures that each PSP service is instantiated only once and reused across the application.
  
  The `MerchantsPaymentsService` class serves as the **service factory** to retrieve the correct PSP service instance:

  ```php
  class MerchantsPaymentsService
  {
      public function getService(string $psp): PaymentServiceInterface
    {
        if ($psp === 'stripe') {
            return StripePaymentService::getInstance('pk_test_default', 'sk_test_default');
        }

        if ($psp === 'pin') {
            return PinPaymentService::getInstance('pk_test_default', 'sk_test_default');
        }

        // Throw an exception if the PSP is not supported
        throw new \Exception("Payment service provider {$psp} is not supported.");
    }
  }
  ```

- This approach makes the system more efficient and ensures that the payment service is only instantiated once per request cycle.

### **3. IoC Container & Dependency Injection**

- Laravel's **Service Container** is used to manage and inject dependencies. The **singleton pattern** is applied here as well, where the PSP services are **bound** in the container so that they are shared throughout the application's lifecycle:

  ```php
  $this->app->singleton(StripePaymentService::class, function ($app) {
      return new StripePaymentService('sk_test_default', 'pk_test_default');
  });

  $this->app->singleton(PinPaymentService::class, function ($app) {
      return new PinPaymentService('pin_test_default', 'pin_test_default');
  });
  ```

- This allows the `PaymentController` to **inject the PSP service** dynamically using Laravelâ€™s dependency injection system, ensuring that dependencies are resolved automatically.

### **4. Unit Testing with Mocking (Mockery & PestPHP)**

- To ensure that the tests are fast and isolated from external services, **Mockery** is used to **mock** external dependencies like the payment services. This eliminates the need for real API calls during testing.

  For instance, the `StripePaymentService` can be mocked as follows:

  ```php
  $mockService = \Mockery::mock(StripePaymentService::class);
  $mockService->shouldReceive('charge')->andReturn(['success' => true]);
  app()->instance(StripePaymentService::class, $mockService);
  ```

- This guarantees that the tests remain **independent** of external APIs and are **efficient**.

### **5. Error Handling & Logging**

- A robust error-handling mechanism is in place to ensure that the system gracefully handles failures. Errors are logged using Laravelâ€™s built-in logging features, providing insight into issues without interrupting the flow of the application:

  ```php
  catch (\Exception $e) {
      Log::error('Stripe Payment Error', ['error' => $e->getMessage()]);
  }
  ```

## **Payment Flow Execution (High-Level Process)**

1. **Merchant Configuration**  
   Merchants specify their `active_psp` (e.g., `stripe` or `pinpayments`) and configure their API keys in the database.

2. **User Payment Request**  
   Users initiate a payment by sending a request to charge a card (`POST /api/merchants/{merchantId}/charge`). The request is validated using Laravel's built-in validation tools.

3. **PSP Selection & Processing**  
   The `PaymentController` utilizes the `MerchantsPaymentsService` to dynamically select the correct PSP based on the merchantâ€™s configuration and processes the payment.

4. **Response Handling**  
   If the payment is successful, the payment intent ID is returned. In case of failure (e.g., invalid API key), the error is logged and an appropriate message is returned to the user.

## **Key Technologies & Frameworks**

- **Laravel 10** - Backend framework
- **Stripe API / PinPayments API** - Payment processing
- **SOLID Principles** - Clean architecture, Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Singleton Pattern** - Efficient service resolution
- **Dependency Injection & IoC** - Laravel's service container
- **Mockery & PestPHP** - Unit testing and mocking
- **Logging & Exception Handling** - Error resilience

## **Conclusion**

This architecture provides **modularity, extensibility, and maintainability** while ensuring that the payment logic remains **agnostic** to any specific PSP. New PSPs can be integrated seamlessly by implementing the `PaymentServiceInterface` and updating the service factory. By leveraging **Dependency Injection**, **Singletons**, and **Mocking**, the system is **robust, scalable, and easy to maintain**. This approach also ensures that the application can evolve to support additional PSPs with minimal changes to existing code. ðŸš€

## Overview

### What is Structure CLI?

In todayâ€™s fast-paced development environment, having a well-organized project structure is essential for efficiency and collaboration. This is where **Structure CLI** comes into play. Itâ€™s a powerful command-line tool designed to help developers generate a predefined directory structure and files based on a simple YAML configuration file. Whether you're setting up a new project or restructuring an existing one, Structure CLI makes it easy to manage your project files with just a few commands.

## Key Features

- **YAML-Based Configuration:** Use a straightforward YAML file to define your project structure.
- **Flexible Directory Creation:** Create the project structure directly in the current directory or specify a root directory name.
- **Easy to Use:** Simply run the CLI with your desired flags and watch as the necessary directories and files are created automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Go** (version 1.16 or later)

## Installation

Setting up Structure CLI is a breeze. Follow these steps to get it up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:johnretsas/structure.git
   cd structure
   ```

2. **Build the binary:**

   ```bash
   go build -o structure
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the CLI built, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./structure [flags]
```

### Available Flags

- `--here`  
  Create the project structure directly in the current directory, bypassing the creation of a project root.

- `--project-root <name>`  
  Specify a name for the project root directory. This flag is required unless `--here` is set.

- `--structure <filename>`  
  Define the YAML file that contains the project structure (default is `structure.yaml`).

### Example Usage

1. **Create a project structure in the current directory:**

   ```bash
   ./structure --here
   ```

2. **Create a project structure with a specified project root:**

   ```bash
   ./structure --project-root my_project
   ```

## Defining Your Project Structure

The YAML file plays a crucial role in defining the structure of your project. Here's a sample configuration to help you get started:

```yaml
project:
  main.go: file
  pkg:
    utils.go: file
    helpers.go: file
  cmd:
    myapp.go: file
  internal:
    db:
      connection.go: file
    api:
      handler.go: file
  README.md: file
  LICENSE: file
```

In this example:
- Each entry represents a file or directory.
- Directories are indicated by a colon at the end of the name, while files are listed without one.

## Conclusion

The Structure CLI is a must-have tool for developers looking to streamline their project setup process. By leveraging the power of YAML, you can create, manage, and organize your project directories and files efficiently. Whether you're launching a new project or re-structuring an existing one, Structure CLI has you covered.

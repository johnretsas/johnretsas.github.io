## Overview

### The Auction Processing Challenge

Imagine you're building a car auction platform where users place bids between **10 AM and 3 PM**. At **3 PM**, the system needs to process all bids and determine the highest bid for each car. If the highest bid meets or exceeds the **reserve price**, the car is marked as **sold**. Otherwise, it is **relisted** for the next auction.

To handle large volumes of bids efficiently, we need a system that can:

- Scale to process thousands of bids.
- Ensure only the highest bid for each car is processed.
- Prevent a single Lambda function from timing out.

## System Architecture

The solution consists of three key AWS components:

1. **Trigger Lambda** â€“ Queries DynamoDB for all bids placed that day and sends them to an **SQS queue**.
2. **SQS Queue** â€“ Buffers messages, allowing parallel processing by multiple worker Lambdas.
3. **Worker Lambda** â€“ Processes each bid, determines if it exceeds the reserve price, and updates the **Car Database**.

## Step 1: Trigger Lambda

At **3 PM**, the Trigger Lambda is executed, fetching all bids from the **Car Bids Table** and sending them to the **SQS queue** in batches.

### Key Features:
- Queries DynamoDB for all bids between **10 AM and 3 PM**.
- Sorts bids by **amount (descending order)**.
- Sends the highest bid for each car to **SQS**.

### Code Example:

```python
import boto3
import json
from datetime import datetime

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')

queue_url = 'YOUR_SQS_QUEUE_URL'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    today = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    response = dynamodb.query(
        TableName='CarBidsTable',
        KeyConditionExpression='bidTimestamp BETWEEN :startTime AND :endTime',
        ExpressionAttributeValues={
            ':startTime': {'S': f'{today}T10:00:00'},
            ':endTime': {'S': f'{today}T15:00:00'}
        }
    )
    
    bids = response.get('Items', [])
    highest_bids_map = {}
    
    for bid in bids:
        car_id = bid['carId']['S']
        bid_amount = float(bid['bidAmount']['N'])
        
        if car_id not in highest_bids_map or bid_amount > highest_bids_map[car_id]:
            highest_bids_map[car_id] = bid_amount
    
    for car_id, highest_bid in highest_bids_map.items():
        message = {
            'carId': car_id,
            'bidAmount': highest_bid
        }
        sqs.send_message(
            QueueUrl=queue_url,
            MessageBody=json.dumps(message)
        )
    
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': f'{len(highest_bids_map)} bids sent to SQS.'}
```

## Step 2: SQS Queue

The **SQS queue** acts as a buffer, ensuring that the **Worker Lambda** can process bids asynchronously and at scale. Since SQS allows multiple workers to process messages in parallel, it prevents the system from overloading.

## Step 3: Worker Lambda

The **Worker Lambda** processes messages from SQS and updates the **Car Database**.

### Steps:
1. Reads the **highest bid** for a car from SQS.
2. Fetches the **carâ€™s reserve price** from the **Car Database**.
3. If the bid is **above the reserve price**, marks the car as **sold**.
4. If the bid is **below the reserve price**, leaves the car for the next auction.

### Code Example:

```python
import boto3
import json

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

car_table = 'CarDatabase'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        message = json.loads(record['body'])
        car_id = message['carId']
        highest_bid = float(message['bidAmount'])
        
        response = dynamodb.get_item(TableName=car_table, Key={'carId': {'S': car_id}})
        car = response.get('Item')
        reserve_price = float(car['reservePrice']['N'])
        
        if highest_bid >= reserve_price:
            dynamodb.update_item(
                TableName=car_table,
                Key={'carId': {'S': car_id}},
                UpdateExpression='SET reservePriceCovered = :true',
                ExpressionAttributeValues={':true': {'BOOL': True}}
            )
    
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Processing complete.'}
```

## Optimizing Bid Selection in Trigger Lambda

By default, the **Trigger Lambda** sends all bids to SQS, but we can optimize this further:

### Problem:
- Without filtering, multiple bids for the same car may be sent to SQS, leading to redundant processing.

### Solution:
- The **Trigger Lambda** maintains a dictionary of the highest bid per car.
- It only sends **one bid per car** to SQS, reducing queue load and speeding up processing.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces SQS processing time** by filtering lower bids.
- **Prevents redundant work** in Worker Lambda.
- **Optimizes cost** by minimizing unnecessary Lambda executions.

## Conclusion

This architecture ensures that our auction system can handle large numbers of bids efficiently. By leveraging **AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS**, we achieve a **scalable, serverless auction processing system** that optimizes performance and minimizes redundant processing.

### Key Takeaways:
- Use **DynamoDB + SQS + Lambda** for scalable bid processing.
- **Trigger Lambda** fetches bids, selects only the highest per car, and sends them to SQS.
- **Worker Lambda** processes bids and updates the **Car Database**.
- Optimizing the **Trigger Lambda** reduces redundant processing and saves costs.

This approach can be applied to **any auction-style system** requiring efficient real-time bid processing. ðŸš€

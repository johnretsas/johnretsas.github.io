## Overview

### Renaming a Commit in a Pull Request (Conventional Commits Style)

Clear and consistent **commit messages** make your Git history easier to understand, review, and automate. In many teams, developers follow the **Conventional Commits** convention, where commit messages follow a strict format like:

```
feat: add new user registration flow
fix: handle edge case in pricing logic
docs: update API usage examples
```

If you've already pushed a commit and realize it needs renaming—for clarity, convention, or feedback—you can **rename it using interactive rebase**.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Why Rename a Commit?**
  To clarify the commit’s purpose, correct formatting, or align with a commit style guide (e.g., Conventional Commits).

* **What Are Conventional Commits?**
  A standardized format for commit messages that makes history easier to parse for humans and tools alike. Example:

  ```
  type(scope): subject
  ```

  * `type`: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, etc.
  * `scope`: optional; e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`
  * `subject`: short, imperative sentence (no period)

## Step-by-Step: How to Rename a Commit

We’ll walk through renaming a commit using `git rebase -i`, with an **animated terminal demo** below.

### 1. Check Your Recent Commits

```bash
git log --oneline
```

```
h7i8j9k docs(readme): update API usage
d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes
a1b2c3d fix(layout): correct mobile nav overflow
```

Suppose we want to **rename** `feat(ui): add spacing utility classes`.

---

### 2. Start Interactive Rebase

Count how many commits back the target is. In this case, 2.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

---

### 3. Interactive Editor Opens

```text
pick a1b2c3d fix(layout): correct mobile nav overflow
pick d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes
pick h7i8j9k docs(readme): update API usage
```

Change `pick` to `reword` for the commit to rename:

```text
pick a1b2c3d fix(layout): correct mobile nav overflow
reword d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes
pick h7i8j9k docs(readme): update API usage
```

Save and close (`:wq` in Vim).

### 4. Enter the New Commit Message

You'll be prompted to enter a new message:

```text
feat(ui): add utility classes for margin and padding
```

Make the message **specific and Conventional Commit-compliant**. Save and exit.


### 5. Force Push the Updated History

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name --force
```

> 🔄 This updates the remote branch used in your PR with the renamed commit.


## 🎞️ Animated Terminal Demo

Here’s a **text-based animation** of the full flow:

```bash
# Show commit history
$ git log --oneline

h7i8j9k docs(readme): update API usage
d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes
a1b2c3d fix(layout): correct mobile nav overflow

# Start rebase
$ git rebase -i HEAD~3

# (Interactive editor opens)
# Change:
#   pick d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes
# To:
#   reword d4e5f6g feat(ui): add spacing utility classes

# Save and close (:wq)

# Prompted to edit commit message
# Update it to:
feat(ui): add utility classes for margin and padding

# Save and close (:wq)

# Push the updated history
$ git push origin your-branch-name --force
```

## Conclusion

Renaming a commit using `git rebase -i` is a clean and controlled way to maintain a meaningful Git history—especially when paired with the **Conventional Commits** format. This not only improves collaboration and reviewability but also supports automated tools like changelog generators and CI pipelines.

Well-written commits = professional, maintainable projects.

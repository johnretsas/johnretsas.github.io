# Real-Time Chat App Architecture

Building a real-time chat app comes with unique challenges: it must be **fast**, **scalable**, and **reliable**. No user wants delayed messages or interruptions. Additionally, as chat apps grow, scalability becomes a critical concern to ensure a smooth user experience. 

This blog explores an architecture that provides a **robust, decoupled** solution for a chat system, focusing on AWS services to achieve scalability and reliability.

## Core Features  

For this real-time chat app, we aim to provide:  

- **Almost real-time delivery** of messages.  
- **Scalability** to handle growing user bases.  
- **Durable message storage** for persistence.  
- **Notifications** for active users.  
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** to enhance reliability.  
- **Presence tracking** to determine user availability.  
- **Load balancing** for even traffic distribution.  
- **Microservices architecture** for decoupling key components.

## High-Level Design  

The architecture is centered around a **decoupled event-driven model** leveraging AWS services like **SQS**, **DynamoDB**, and **ECS**. Here's the high-level workflow:  

1. **Message Sending**: Clients send messages to an SQS queue.  
2. **Message Processing**: A Lambda function consumes the messages and writes them to DynamoDB.  
3. **Notification Decoupling**: Notifications are sent to a separate SQS queue for active users.  
4. **WebSocket Service**: An ECS cluster maintains WebSocket connections and delivers notifications.  

---

## Components  

### Client üåê  

Clients (e.g., web or mobile apps) interact with the backend via:  

- **REST API**: For operations like sending messages or retrieving historical data.  
- **WebSocket**: For receiving real-time notifications.  

Using tools like **React** for the frontend ensures a responsive user interface.  

---

### Message Flow üì§  

1. **Sending Messages**  
   - User A sends a message to User B.  
   - The client posts the message to an SQS queue (`Messages Queue`).  
   - Example Message:  
     ```json
     {
       "MessageID": "msg-12345",
       "SenderID": "user-a",
       "RecipientID": "user-b",
       "Timestamp": "2024-11-27T12:00:00Z",
       "MessageText": "Hello, world!"
     }
     ```  

2. **Processing Messages**  
   - A Lambda function consumes the queue, processes the message, and writes it to a DynamoDB table.  
   - DynamoDB schema:  
     - **Partition Key**: `ChatID`  
     - **Sort Key**: `Timestamp`  
   - Messages are stored durably for retrieval.  

---

### Notification Flow üîî  

1. **Decoupling Notifications**  
   - The same Lambda function sends a notification task to a second SQS queue (`Notification Queue`).  

2. **Consuming Notifications**  
   - An ECS cluster consumes the `Notification Queue` and sends notifications to active users via WebSocket.  

3. **WebSocket Connections**  
   - User WebSocket connections are managed in a DynamoDB table:  
     - **Partition Key**: `UserID`  
     - **Attributes**: `ConnectionID`, `LastActive`  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "UserID": "user-b",
       "ConnectionID": "conn-78910",
       "LastActive": "2024-11-27T11:59:00Z"
     }
     ```  

4. **Notification Payload**  
   - Notifications are lightweight:  
     ```json
     {
       "RecipientID": "user-b",
       "MessageText": "Hello, world!",
       "Timestamp": "2024-11-27T12:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

## Fault Tolerance and Scalability üõ°Ô∏è  

### Fault Tolerance  
- **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)** for both SQS queues ensure unprocessed messages are not lost.  
- **Write-Ahead Logs (WALs)** capture messages before they are processed, adding durability.  
- **WebSocket Health Checks** ensure stale connections are removed.  

### Scalability  
- **ECS Autoscaling** dynamically adjusts resources based on user activity.  
- **DynamoDB Autoscaling** handles spikes in read/write throughput.  
- **SQS** decouples components, enabling independent scaling of message processing and notifications.  

---

## Conclusion üöÄ  

This architecture leverages AWS services like SQS, DynamoDB, and ECS to create a real-time chat app that is:  

- **Scalable**: Handles millions of users.  
- **Reliable**: Ensures message durability and fault tolerance.  
- **Fast**: Minimizes latency for real-time experiences.  

While there are many ways to build a chat app, this design offers a solid foundation to scale your application as your user base grows.

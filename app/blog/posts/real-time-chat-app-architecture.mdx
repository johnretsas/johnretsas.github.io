# Introduction

Creating a real-time chat app presents us with a few challenges. Namely, it has to be **fast**, **scalable**, and **reliable**. No user wants a chat app to work slowly or for their messages to go undelivered. Furthermore, the more users a chat app gets, the more valuable it becomes. 

There are as many chat app architectures as there are chat apps, each with peculiarities that require attention. Without specific references, I will outline an architecture for developing a robust chat system that scales and provides a pleasant user experience.

### Basic Features

For this project, we'll focus on implementing the following features:

- **Almost real-time delivery of messages** (we’ll discuss the “almost” part later)
- **Scalability**
- **Permanent storage of messages**
- **Notifications** for connected users
- **Write-ahead logging** for robust message handling
- **Presence tracking** for users
- **Load balancing**
- **Microservices architecture**, decoupling crucial components

## Deriving the Architecture

### Client

We start with the **clients**. For simplicity, let’s consider a web-based chat app. Using standard web tools like React, we can implement a UI for users to:

- Log into the app
- View their list of chats
- Exchange messages with other users

Since SEO is not a requirement (everything is private and behind authentication), there’s no need for a server-side rendering (SSR) solution.

---

### Sending Messages

Let’s say **User A** sends a message to **User B**. Two key considerations are:

1. The message must be **permanently stored**.
2. **User B must receive it.**

We'll use a **message broker** to handle message transmission. Clients send messages to this broker, which processes them in a **scalable** and **decoupled** way. 

For this architecture, we’ll use **Amazon SQS** to store messages. Since processing may occasionally fail, we’ll include a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** as a companion to the main queue for handling problematic messages.

---

### Consuming Messages for Permanent Storage

The **SQS queue** will be consumed by either an **ECS cluster** or a **Lambda function**. For simplicity, let’s choose a Lambda function. 

- The Lambda function subscribes to the SQS queue and polls messages for consumption.
- Messages are processed and stored in a **DynamoDB table**.

---

### Decoupling Notifications

To handle notifications for active users, the same Lambda function will send a **notification message** for each processed message to a separate **Notification Messages queue**. This queue will also have an associated DLQ.

---

### Consuming Notification Messages

Real-time notifications require **WebSocket connections** between the server and the clients. Since **Lambda functions** terminate after completing tasks, they’re not suitable for maintaining persistent connections.

Instead, we’ll use an **ECS cluster** to:

- Maintain WebSocket connections
- Send real-time notifications to users

Additionally, a **DynamoDB table** will store the connection IDs to facilitate message delivery.

This architecture provides a foundation for building a fast, scalable, and reliable chat application while addressing challenges like message persistence, real-time notifications, and scalability.
